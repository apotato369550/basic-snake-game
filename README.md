# basic-snake-game
A basic snake game made in HTML and Javascript.

I made this project to learn more about Javascript and game physics. It's very simple, but it works pretty well. I learned a lot from making it.

I based this project on a tutorial I found on Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21eSpMtJwrc
The guy's repo: https://github.com/kriscfoster/Snake-Game

I changed some parts of the code to have a better understanding. I hope you enjoy:)
